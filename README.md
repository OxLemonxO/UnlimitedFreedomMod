# UnlimitedFreedomMod #

UnlimitedMod is a CraftBukkit server plugin designed primarily to support the [Official UnlimitedFreedom Minecraft Server](http://unlimitedfreedom.boards.net). However, you are more than welcome to adapt the source for your own server.

This plugin was originally coded by StevenLawson (Madgeek1450), with Jerom van der Sar (Prozza) becoming heavily involved in its development some time later for TotalFreedom, then edited by our developers for UnlimitedFreedom. It consists of over 85 custom coded commands and a large variety of distinguishable features not included in any other plugin. The plugin has since its beginning grown immensely. Together, with the main UnlimitedFreedom server, UnlimitedFreedomMod has a long-standing reputation of effectiveness whilst maintaining a clear feeling of openness towards the administrators and the players themselves.
